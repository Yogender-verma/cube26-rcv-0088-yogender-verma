**Track:** 01 · Receiving Manager (Step 1 of 5 in Commerce Stream)  
**Evaluation Target:** Single-Pass Batch Vision Receiving Inspection Agent (`ReceivingManagerAgent`)  
**Methodology:** Deterministic Rule & Heuristic Validation on Synthetic Fixture Suite

## 1. Executive Summary & Honest Methodology Statement

Evaluation was conducted against a test suite of **50 synthetic units** (`EVAL-UNIT-0001` through `EVAL-UNIT-0050`) generated deterministically to validate rule enforcement, schema safety, fail-open circuit breaking, and uncertainty propagation across five core receiving dimensions: SKU Identity, Quantity Verification, Carton Damage, Unit Damage, and Spec Quality.

### Methodology Disclosures:
- **Synthetic Data:** All 50 units and images are programmatic synthetic fixtures generated with Pillow (`fixtures_generator.py`). They are not human-captured real warehouse dock photographs.
- **Annotators:** "Labeller A" and "Labeller B" are programmatic consensus fixtures used to validate the implementation of the Cohen's Kappa scoring formula, not independent human auditors.
- **Metric Scope:** The 100% accuracy result represents **Synthetic Fixture Decision Accuracy** (exact agreement between deterministic rules and synthetic fixtures). It demonstrates rule adherence and schema compliance, but does not claim empirical open-world generalization.
- **AI Separation:** Runs in **Demo Mode (Synthetic Heuristic Engine)** by default when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not set; invokes **Real AI Mode (Google Gemini Multimodal API)** when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured. If live AI fails, it triggers the fail-open circuit breaker and never silently fabricates mock results.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Units Evaluated:** 50
- **Evaluation Type:** Synthetic Fixture Rule Validation
- **Cohen's Kappa (Formula Verification):** **1.00**
- **Synthetic Fixture Decision Accuracy (excl. UNCERTAIN):** **100.0%** (43 of 43 judged units match rule specs)
- **Precision:** **1.000**
- **Recall:** **1.000**
- **F1-Score:** **1.000**
- **False Positives (FP):** **0**
- **False Negatives (FN):** **0**
- **UNCERTAIN Verdict Rate:** **14.0% (7 units)** (Cleanly identified due to visual glare/blur)
- **Fail-Open Recovery Rate:** **100%** (Timeouts produce PENDING_REVIEW; retry re-evaluates cleanly)

## 2. Dataset Composition Table

| Scenario Category | Unit ID Range | Count | Ground Truth | Visual Evidence State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Clean Inbound (PASS)** | `EVAL-0001` – `EVAL-0025` | 25 | **PASS** | Intact cartons, matching SKU barcode, verified 24/24 count |
| **Carton Crushing (FAIL)** | `EVAL-0026` – `EVAL-0035` | 10 | **FAIL** | Visible corner deformation, structural compression |
| **Spec / Component Mismatch (FAIL)** | `EVAL-0036` – `EVAL-0043` | 8 | **FAIL** | Wrong colour (Red vs Blue), missing accessories (no scoop) |
| **Ambiguous / Occluded (UNCERTAIN)** | `EVAL-0044` – `EVAL-0050` | 7 | **UNCERTAIN** | Severe motion blur, warehouse spotlight glare, unreadable barcode |

## 4. Per-Check Sub-Dimension Metrics (Dynamically Computed)

| Check Name | Evaluated Units | Accuracy on Evaluated | False Positives | False Negatives | UNCERTAIN Count |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Product / SKU Identity** | 43 | 100.0% | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| **Quantity Verification** | 50 | 100.0% | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Carton Physical Damage** | 43 | 100.0% | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| **Unit Physical Damage** | 43 | 100.0% | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| **Spec Quality Flags** | 50 | 100.0% | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## 5. Documented Failure Modes

1. **Visual Glare & Polybag Reflection:** Ceiling lighting reflecting on shrink wrap (7 units). Correctly routed to UNCERTAIN.
2. **Subtle Corner Compression:** Corner compression < 10% volume requires multi-angle captures.
3. **Foreign Supplier Typography:** Non-standard dot-matrix fonts require fallback to barcode scanning.
4. **Sealed Packaging:** Directly observed count separated from inferred count to prevent hallucination.
