## Press Release (PR)

### NEW YORK — September 27, 2026 — Announcing Receiving Manager: Automated Point-of-Receipt Verification for E-Commerce Supply Chains

Today, we introduced **Receiving Manager**, an intelligent computer vision agent engineered to audit inbound supplier deliveries at the warehouse receiving dock. By capturing visual evidence and performing multi-point specification checks immediately upon carton opening, Receiving Manager locks in supplier accountability before goods enter warehouse storage.

Receiving Manager integrates directly into warehouse receiving stations, running unified single-pass batch vision models across PO identity matching, carton quantity counts, crushing detection, water intrusion, and variant specs.

"Supplier disputes are won or lost in the first 5 minutes after a container opens," said Yogender Verma, lead developer. "Receiving Manager turns point-of-receipt photography into legally defensible claims evidence."

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Does Receiving Manager slow down dock operators?
No. The agent operates under a strict **Fail-Open Policy** (Engineering Rule 3). If model vision latency spikes or network connection drops, the capture is preserved as `PENDING_REVIEW` and the operator proceeds without waiting.

### Q2: Why is batching model calls mandatory?
Batching all 5 checks into a single vision pass (Engineering Rule 2) reduces API costs by 80% and ensures sub-500ms response times at high warehouse volume.

### Q3: How does Receiving Manager handle blurry or occluded photographs?
Unlike traditional vision classifiers that force a binary PASS/FAIL, Receiving Manager treats **UNCERTAIN** as a first-class verdict (Engineering Rule 4), notifying shift supervisors for secondary verification.

### Q4: What happens when an operator overrides an agent decision?
Overrides are treated as immutable data (Honesty Rule). The original verdict, modified verdict, operator ID, and mandatory justification reason are saved permanently in the audit ledger.

### Q5: How is multi-tenancy enforced?
Row-Level Security (RLS) is forced on every database query (Engineering Rule 1). Org B receives 0 rows when attempting to access Org A's records or image fixtures.
