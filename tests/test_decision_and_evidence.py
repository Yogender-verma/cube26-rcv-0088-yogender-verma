"""
Automated Decision System & Evidence Traceability Test Suite
Tests:
- Deterministic decision aggregation (FAIL -> EXCEPTION, UNCERTAIN -> UNCERTAIN, PASS -> PASS)
- Evidence contract schema validation
- Traceability: Expected vs Observed vs Checked vs Why
- Operator override retains original AI verdict and logs audit trail
